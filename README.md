This is a restaurant recommendation software that ask for location and cuisine and plot them on map;
- extracted dataset from kaggle(from swiggy)
- performed EDA and feature engineering on it to filter necessary information,
- implemented a "geocoding" library API that extracted coordinates of the restaurant provided with address and city details,
- visualized restaurant on map using "folium library",
- created and hosted on streamlit.

I have made notebook of the eda private because it was messy.
