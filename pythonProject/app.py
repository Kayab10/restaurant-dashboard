'- extracted dataset from kaggle(from swiggy)'
'- performed EDA and feature engineering on it to filter necessary information,'
'- implemented a "geocoding" library API that extracted coordinates of the restaurant provided with address and city details,'
'- visualized restaurant on map using "folium library",'
'- created and hosted on streamlit.')
